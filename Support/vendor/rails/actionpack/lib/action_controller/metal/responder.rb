module ActionController #:nodoc:
  # Responder is responsible to expose a resource for different mime requests,
  # usually depending on the HTTP verb. The responder is triggered when
  # respond_with is called. The simplest case to study is a GET request:
  #
  #   class PeopleController < ApplicationController
  #     respond_to :html, :xml, :json
  #
  #     def index
  #       @people = Person.find(:all)
  #       respond_with(@people)
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # When a request comes, for example with format :xml, three steps happen:
  #
  #   1) respond_with searches for a template at people/index.xml;
  #
  #   2) if the template is not available, it will create a responder, passing
  #      the controller and the resource and invoke :to_xml on it;
  #
  #   3) if the responder does not respond_to :to_xml, call to_format on it.
  #
  # === Builtin HTTP verb semantics
  #
  # Rails default responder holds semantics for each HTTP verb. Depending on the
  # content type, verb and the resource status, it will behave differently.
  #
  # Using Rails default responder, a POST request for creating an object could
  # be written as:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @user = User.new(params[:user])
  #     flash[:notice] = 'User was successfully created.' if @user.save
  #     respond_with(@user)
  #   end
  #
  # Which is exactly the same as:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @user = User.new(params[:user])
  #
  #     respond_to do |format|
  #       if @user.save
  #         flash[:notice] = 'User was successfully created.'
  #         format.html { redirect_to(@user) }
  #         format.xml { render :xml => @user, :status => :created, :location => @user }
  #       else
  #         format.html { render :action => "new" }
  #         format.xml { render :xml => @user.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # The same happens for PUT and DELETE requests.
  #
  # === Nested resources
  #
  # You can given nested resource as you do in form_for and polymorphic_url.
  # Consider the project has many tasks example. The create action for
  # TasksController would be like:
  #
  #   def create
  #     @project = Project.find(params[:project_id])
  #     @task = @project.comments.build(params[:task])
  #     flash[:notice] = 'Task was successfully created.' if @task.save
  #     respond_with([@project, @task])
  #   end
  #
  # Giving an array of resources, you ensure that the responder will redirect to
  # project_task_url instead of task_url.
  #
  # Namespaced and singleton resources requires a symbol to be given, as in
  # polymorphic urls. If a project has one manager which has many tasks, it
  # should be invoked as:
  #
  #   respond_with([@project, :manager, @task])
  #
  # Check polymorphic_url documentation for more examples.
